A high performance networking API which at its peak had a user base of several hundred. The API has been integrated into the computer game Evochron Mercenary (https://store.steampowered.com/app/71000/Evochron_Mercenary/). The API was marketed and sold by https://www.thegamecreators.com who used it as the networking backbone for their game development programming languages. The system was developed using native C++ and Winsock. It uses low level Windows APIs (e.g. completion ports, overlapped I/O) to handle UDP and TCP data transfer between systems and has a highly scalable multi-threaded design.
